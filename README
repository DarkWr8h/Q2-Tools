Q2 Tools
Haxxoring tools for Samsung YP-Q2 PMP

The theme_stuff folder contains pretty much everything you need to make/edit UCI themes.
unpack.sh and repack.sh will help you to make your fw haxx, remember that /mnt/usb points
to the usb partition so you might want to load stuff from there.
Don't kill AppMain at bootup if you want to preserve the player life :P
Ive included a legacy version of the squashfs tools to extract the rootfs content.
I'm using codesourcery's g++ arm toolchain lite to compile stuff and it works well, set your
compiler in the makefile if different.

Say hello to the first hello world on this device :D

Howto:

1 - Place the update named Q2Update.dat in this folder
2 - Run the unpack.sh script
3 - Get into q2update_unpacked/appfs/ and open the file runusb.sh
4 - Add '/mnt/usb/mycode.sh' (w/o quotes) after the USBSrv line
5 - Run the repack.sh script and flash the HACK.dat image (rename it to Q2Update.dat and throw it into the root)
6 - Create a file called 'mycode.sh' into the usb root and write this script:

#!/bin/sh
sleep 10
if [ -f /mnt/usb/runcode ]; then 
    rm -f /mnt/usb/runcode
    killall -9 AppMain
    sleep 6
    /mnt/usb/hello
fi

7 - Create a file called runcode and copy the hello world binary into the root called 'hello'
8 - Disconnect the usb and hard reset the player using the hole on the back
9 - Watch the hello world running :D
