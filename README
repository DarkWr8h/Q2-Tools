Q2 Tools
Haxxoring tools for Samsung YP-Q2 PMP

The theme_stuff folder contains pretty much everything you need to make/edit UCI themes.
unpack.sh and repack.sh will help you to make your fw haxx, remember that /mnt/usb points
to the usb partition so you might want to load stuff from there.
Don't kill AppMain at bootup if you want to preserve the player life :P
Ive included a legacy version of the squashfs tools to extract the rootfs content.
The hello world is still a wip!
I'm using codesourcery's g++ arm toolchain lite to compile stuff and it works well, set your
compiler in the makefile if different.
